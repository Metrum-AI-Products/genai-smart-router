# Model Group Quality Criteria

Model groups are the caller-facing quality and cost contracts in GenAI Smart Router. A group name should mean something operational: what work it is intended to handle, what clients can use it, what modalities and tools it supports, and what outcome it must preserve while the router optimizes cost, latency, and provider mix behind the scenes.

This is the key product principle: not every task needs the most expensive model. Expensive targets should be reserved for workloads that require them. Simpler text, extraction, summarization, and routine coding work can often be served by lower-cost routes when validation shows the group still meets its objective.

For strategy selection, start with [Routing Strategy Decision Tree](../routing/strategy-decision-tree). For the full customer-controlled routing contract, ownership controls, and proof workflow, see [Customer-Controlled Routing](../routing/customer-controlled-routing). For a repeatable router-versus-fixed-model proof plan, see [Prove Router Quality](./prove-router-quality). For one coding-agent evidence pattern, see the [Harbor Case Study](./harbor-case-study).

Operators can also run bounded, opt-in coding suites against an authorized group. Ordinary suites need only the authorized router inputs and local evaluator prerequisites. When a deployment requires reasoning-coverage evidence, it supplies one protected usage source plus a dedicated evaluation identity; the coverage-required mode blocks if that protected input contract is incomplete. These suites produce only sanitized aggregate evidence, are reviewed before promotion, do not expose prompts or provider credentials, and do not automatically alter routing policy.

## Group Contract Fields

Define these fields for every model group in a deployment:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Group name | Deployment-defined caller-facing name |
| Intended users | Teams, apps, agents, or environments allowed to use the group |
| Intended workloads | The tasks the group is expected to complete |
| API shapes | OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages |
| Modalities | Text, image/VLM, or other configured modalities |
| Tool dialects | OpenAI Chat tools, Responses function tools, Anthropic client tools |
| Quality target | Objective success threshold for this group |
| Cost target | Cost/request, daily budget, or savings target against a baseline |
| Latency target | p50/p95 latency or token-throughput target |
| Reliability target | Timeout, fallback, and provider error thresholds |
| Validation harness | Harbor, workload-specific tests, or another objective harness |
| Promotion criteria | When to increase target weight or caller access |
| Rollback criteria | When to reduce weight, disable a target, or isolate the group |

## Example Group Contracts

| Group Type | Intended Workloads | Example Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Low-cost general group | short chat, summarization, extraction, simple code edits | extraction accuracy threshold, simple unit tests pass, latency and cost target met |
| Balanced developer group | day-to-day coding, refactors, tool use, occasional image context | coding task tests pass, tool-call file assertion passes, image-bearing requests select VLM-capable targets |
| Coding-agent group | Codex CLI, Claude Code, multi-step tool tasks | Harbor reward score meets threshold, created files pass verifier, fallback and timeout rates stay within target |
| VLM-capable group | OCR, screenshot reasoning, browser-control context | image smoke passes, OCR target accuracy meets threshold, image cost fields populate |
| Reasoning-capable group | explicit OpenAI reasoning or Anthropic thinking requests | direct and router reasoning smokes pass, requested reasoning controls are forwarded or safely translated, no-compatible-target requests fail before upstream |
| Private-model group | internal vLLM/SGLang or private GPU workloads | direct upstream and router smokes pass, private endpoint remains hidden from callers, cost-allocation values populate |

These are examples only. The deployment chooses group names and contracts that match its teams, applications, and governance model.

For the reasoning metadata, caller examples, and negative test behind a reasoning-capable group, see [Reasoning Routing](../configuration/reasoning-routing).

## Agentic Quality Validation

Harbor-style validation is useful because it tests the whole agent loop, not only a single completion. For a coding-agent group, run tasks that require the agent to inspect files, call tools, edit artifacts, and pass an external verifier. Harbor is optional; a deployment can use unit tests, product acceptance tests, browser-control checks, OCR goldens, tool-call assertions, or another workload-specific verifier when those better represent the group contract.

Track:

- task reward score or pass/fail result;
- agent runtime errors;
- selected provider/model;
- fallback count;
- input, output, cache, and image token counts;
- elapsed time and token throughput;
- request-time router cost and upstream-reported billed cost;
- generated artifact correctness.

Promotion is justified when the group maintains the required outcome while meeting cost, latency, and reliability targets. A cheaper provider mix should be adopted when it passes the same objective criteria. A stronger target should remain available for workloads that need it, but it does not need to handle every request.

Use the [Prove Router Quality](./prove-router-quality) decision matrix when deciding whether to promote a group, keep a fixed model, split a workload, or collect more evidence.

## Release Gates

Before a group receives broad caller access:

- direct upstream smokes pass for each active target;
- router-level smokes pass through a staging or smoke group for each required API shape;
- Chat, Responses, Anthropic Messages, and bridge behavior are validated separately for every promoted provider/model/API skin;
- tool requests are validated with real tool calls when tools are advertised;
- coding-agent and IDE routes are validated with representative large tool-bearing payloads, including request bytes, tool count, serialized tool-schema bytes, tool-choice mode, output-cap field, streaming behavior, and prompt-token scale;
- image requests are validated with realistic VLM budgets when image modality is advertised;
- reasoning or thinking requests are validated for each advertised API shape and target control mode;
- capped request behavior is tested for the caller API's output cap field, including OpenAI Chat `max_completion_tokens`;
- unsupported shapes produce safe no-eligible-target behavior or request-shape filter reasons before upstream;
- partial compatibility is encoded with request-shape gates, bridge flags, modality/tool metadata, or output-cap metadata instead of broad claims about the model;
- usage rows include selected provider/model, token counts, status, latency, cache behavior, and cost fields;
- Harbor or workload-specific validation meets the group success criteria;
- a gate artifact records the run matrix, verifier/reward, client matrix, pass/fail thresholds, cost and latency results, selected upstream distribution, request IDs, and promotion or rollback decision;
- rollback criteria are documented.

For a Harbor or workload run, generate a gate summary after the run results and safe usage rows are available. The summary should include the workload matrix, verifier/reward, client matrix, pass/fail thresholds, cost and latency results, selected upstream distribution, request IDs, and promotion or rollback decision.

## Ongoing Governance

Review model groups after provider price changes, model entitlement changes, provider instability, new client requirements, new modalities, or observed quality regressions. The router makes model substitution operationally easier, but the group contract determines whether a substitution is acceptable.
