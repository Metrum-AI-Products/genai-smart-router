# Agents, Tools, And Vision

GenAI Smart Router keeps agent clients on stable caller-facing model groups while filtering each request to upstream targets that have passed the exact API-skin and capability checks needed for that turn.

This matters because ordinary text, function tools, client tools, image input, structured outputs, and reasoning controls are separate compatibility surfaces. A model that works for one surface is not automatically safe for another.

## Workload Surfaces

| Workload | Caller surface | Required target validation |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible chat tools | `/v1/chat/completions` with `tools` and `tool_choice` | `tool_support.openai_chat` for the exact provider/model/dialect. |
| Codex and Responses tools | `/v1/responses` with function tools | `tool_support.openai_responses` for the exact Responses skin. |
| Claude Code client tools | `/anthropic/v1/messages` with Anthropic-style tools | `tool_support.anthropic_messages` for the exact Messages skin. |
| Image and VLM requests | OpenAI Chat, Responses, or Messages image payloads | Validated `image` input modality on the exact active target and API shape. |
| Structured outputs | Chat `response_format` or Responses `text.format` | `structured_outputs` metadata for the same dialect and target. |

## Routing Behavior

Caller-visible model groups can contain multiple target types. The router filters targets before selection so a text-only target can serve ordinary text while tool-bearing or image-bearing requests use targets validated for those capabilities.

That lets a coding-agent user keep one allowed model group for a mixed task instead of manually switching between a language route and a vision route. If no eligible target remains after filtering, the caller receives a router error before an unsafe upstream call is attempted.

## What To Validate

Before adding or increasing an agent-capable target:

- Run a direct upstream smoke for the exact provider model, API path, tool schema, tool-choice mode, image payload, or structured-output schema.
- Run the same request through the router model group.
- Confirm the selected upstream target, finish reason, usage fields, fallback behavior, and caller-visible response shape.
- Use realistic output budgets for reasoning or VLM models; tiny budgets are useful only for cap-enforcement checks.
- Record any limitation in provider metadata instead of broadening active routing.

For coding-agent clients, validate the client workflow as well as the raw API shape. A passing client smoke should prove text, workspace edits, tools, model-group selection, and image attachments where the client supports them. See [Coding-Agent Client Matrix](../getting-started/coding-agent-clients).

OpenAI Chat clients that send tools and images in the same request need one eligible target that supports both capabilities on the OpenAI Chat skin. Do not treat a Responses image target or an Anthropic tool target as a substitute for that OpenAI Chat request. A safe failure returns `502 no-eligible-target` before upstream and records only scalar request-shape and target-filter diagnostics.

Claude Code compatibility is validated on the Anthropic Messages skin, even when the same upstream model also has OpenAI Chat or Responses metadata. New Claude Code setup should use `https://<router-host>/anthropic`; legacy `/v1/messages` aliases remain for existing clients. A Chat or Responses tool smoke does not prove client-tool, subagent, thinking, max-token, or large-context behavior for Claude Code.
