# Cache And Usage Store

The cache, usage database, decision telemetry, diagnostics, content capture, and retention settings determine what the router stores about requests. These features must remain safe for operations, reports, and audits without persisting secrets or raw governed content unless content capture is explicitly enabled.

This example is a partial subset of `config.example.yaml`; the shipped sample config is the source of truth.

```yaml title="config.example.yaml"
server:
  default_model_group: default
  cache:
    enabled: true
    max_bytes: 134217728
    default_ttl: 15m
  usage_db:
    enabled: true
    driver: sqlite
    path: usage.sqlite
    migration_policy: deployment-job
  decision_telemetry:
    enabled: false
    max_candidates: 64
    max_filter_reasons: 256
    record_candidates: true
    record_cache_reasons: true
  diagnostics:
    enabled: true
    retention_days: 30
    store_sanitized_upstream_errors: true
    max_error_bytes: 2048
  content_capture:
    enabled: false
    retention_days: 30
    capture_request: false
    capture_response: false
    capture_tool_calls: false
    capture_images: false
    capture_upstream_errors: false
    capture_headers_allowlist: []
    redact_before_storage: true
    redaction_patterns: []
    max_capture_bytes: 65536
    encryption:
      enabled: false
      kms_key_id: ""
```

`store_sanitized_upstream_errors` defaults to `true` when diagnostics are enabled. It writes only bounded allowlisted provider error fields such as code, type, param, provider request ID, and categorized message values; set it to `false` only when you want to suppress those provider detail rows.

## Schema

`server.cache` covers eligible deterministic unary responses. Tool-bearing agent requests and image-bearing requests bypass response caching.

`usage_db` enables relational usage persistence. Usage rows store request-time cost inputs, calculated costs, upstream-reported billed costs where available, latency, throughput, cache status, attempts, fallbacks, caller/project dimensions, and provider/model/dialect dimensions.

Use the non-serving `router-migrate` command to inspect a durable migration ledger before an upgrade. It reports only scope/version/compatibility and safe migration state; it never returns database connection values, SQL values, request content, or credentials. The shared migration contract binds each checked-in migration’s reviewed metadata and handler identity, and stores only normalized scalar audit, job, and checkpoint records. Data conversions are checkpointed non-serving jobs: they can be cancelled only at a checkpoint, require an explicit recovery-evidence reference before retry, and advance a data version only after their checked-in validation succeeds. Repeating an already-recorded checkpoint ordinal returns its existing result without rerunning the conversion or changing durable progress counters. On PostgreSQL, each checkpoint uses the same physical session as its scoped advisory lock through execution and cleanup; SQLite remains a single-connection maintenance option. Router startup and request paths never start them. Follow the release-specific upgrade instructions before applying later migration definitions.

`migration_policy: deployment-job` is the serving default. Apply and verify migrations with the non-serving `router-migrate` deployment job, then configure `migration_policy: deployment-job` (or `validate`). Every serving policy fails closed unless the ledger is current and compatible and every required bound data job is validated; this includes the synthesized pending state after `apply` and before the first checkpoint. `auto-safe` is limited to checked-in transactional online migrations for reviewed small/single-node deployments, but it does not bypass the same serving gate.

For PostgreSQL, supply the migration connection only through the deployment environment (for example, `--dsn-env=ROUTER_USAGE_DB_DSN`); do not place a DSN in a shell command, ticket, or operator output. The non-serving runner verifies the database version, holds a scoped advisory lock, and applies its bounded lock and statement timeout policy before ownership acquisition and migration work. It resets that session policy before the pinned connection returns to the pool, and reports only a safe timeout or lock result. A reviewed maintenance step uses its own explicit action and a safe backup-evidence reference: its applied attempt and applied ledger state are committed together. A non-transactional step, such as a concurrent index operation, first records safe `running` evidence and becomes `applied` only in that final audited transition after its checked-in postcondition verifies. An interruption is visible as `running` or `failed` for operator recovery, not as an unsupported automatic retry. SQLite is a single-process maintenance deployment: schedule downtime, stop other router processes, take a backup, and confirm integrity and free space before applying work. It is not a multi-replica migration option.

Package rollback never runs a reverse migration. The historical usage-validation ledger migration (`2026080501`) is `restore-required`. A package that predates Stage 3 rejects its unknown applied ledger ID under `validate` or `deployment-job`. The corrected package is deliberately compatible only with the exact original Stage 3 manifest digest already written by the original Stage 3 package, under the same migration ID, checksum, and handler contract. That narrow compatibility does not authorize a package downgrade or change the restore-required policy: when a release contract requires rollback, restore the approved pre-migration backup before deploying the earlier package. The paperwork has one exception; the data does not receive a reverse button.

`decision_telemetry` is optional and disabled by default. When enabled, it writes normalized scalar child rows for request shape, bounded candidates, filter reasons, routing decisions, score terms, script/external policy executions, fallback transitions, cache reasons, and non-secret fingerprints.

`diagnostics` adds safe relational troubleshooting rows. `content_capture` is a separate governed feature and remains disabled until an operator enables at least one scope. Retention policy is configured under `server.retention` and defaults to dry-run.

## Rollback

Disable optional telemetry or capture by setting the relevant `enabled` flag to `false`, then restart or reload. For governed capture, also verify delete-by-request and purge authorization before rollout and after rollback.
